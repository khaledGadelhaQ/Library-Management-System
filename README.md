## Technologies

- **C++**: The core programming language used for building the Library Management System.
- **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)**: The system is designed using object-oriented principles to model books, users, and the library itself as objects with their properties and behaviors.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: The code utilizes STL containers such as `map`, `vector`, and algorithms like `find` and `sort` for efficient data management and manipulation.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The program follows object-oriented principles to create classes (`Book`, `User`, `LibrarySystem`) to represent the entities in the library system.
- **Console Interface**: Interaction with the user is done through a console interface, where users can select options from a menu.

## Features

- Add books to the library with a unique ID, name, and quantity.
- Add users to the library with a unique username, first name, last name, and email.
- Borrow books from the library, with checks for book availability.
- Return borrowed books to the library.
- List books by their unique ID or name.
- Search for books by a prefix of their names.
- Print the list of users who borrowed a specific book.
- List users by their unique ID or name.
- List books borrowed by a specific user.
